Currently, the `edudat` package is under heavy development. Contribitions will be welcomed in a later stage.


## Installation and Usage (mainly for me)



- Install the `edudat` package directly from GitHub (currently not working):
     ```bash
     pip install git+https://github.com/tensorchiefs/data.git#subdirectory=python/edudat
     ```
