# Tensorchiefs Data Collection and Tools

This repository contains [datasets](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/data/blob/main/docs/) as well as R and Python packages for teaching statistics, data science, and related subjects. Our goal is that this package can be used from Python or R on a local machine or in the cloud with the same syntax. All files are cached and dataset-specific functionality can be defined in the optional documentation markdown file. 


## Installation and simple Usage

### R

**Installing the Released Version (no release yet)**

```r
install.packages("https://github.com/tensorchiefs/data/releases/download/testrelease2/edudat_0.1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```           

**Using the R Package**:

Load the `edudat` package and datasets:
  
```R
library(edudat)
df <- load_data("challenger.csv")
```
      
Showing the dataset and other functionality
  
```R
show_data(df)
list_cache_files() #Lists all the cached files
```
      
Sourcing additional functions (currently only in R)
  
```R
source_extra_code(df, verbose = TRUE)
plot(df) + ggtitle("Challenger dataset")
to_celcius(df$Temp)
```
    
Note that not all datasets have additional functions. They need to be defined in an accompanying qmd script in an code section named `extra`, see [data/challenger.qmd](data/challenger.qmd)

### Python

**Installation of the Python Package**:
Install the `edudat` package from PyPI:

``` bash
pip install edudat
```

**Using the Python Package**:
Load the CSV data in Python:

``` python
from edudat import load_data
df1 = load_data("challenger.csv")
```

## Additional information/functionality on data sets

The data sets can be described by quarto (qmd) files. These files contain additional information about the data set, such as a description, the source, the variables, and the data types. The qmd files are located in the `data/` directory and are rendered into the docs branch. The rendered files can be found [https://github.com/tensorchiefs/data/tree/main/docs](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/data/tree/main/docs).


In the cmd files, it is also possible to provide additional code for the data sets. Have a look at the [challenger.qmd](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/data/blob/main/data/challenger.qmd) file for an example, where the R-Code `plot_data` is defined as a named code chunk.

``` r
{r plot_data, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
```

Please ensure that `eval=FALSE` is set in the code chunk options if the code is not supposed to be executed in the automatic rendering.

## Structure

-   `data/`: Contains the CSV data.
-   `R/`: Contains the R package `edudat`.
-   `python/`: Contains the Python package `edudat`.
-   `docs/`: Contain documentation on the dataset

## Advanced Issue

### R

**Installation of the R Package (as in githup main)**:
``` r
install.packages("devtools") #Install the `devtools` package if you haven't already:
#Install the `edudat` package directly from GitHub:
devtools::install_github("tensorchiefs/data/R/edudat")
```
