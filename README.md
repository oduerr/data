# Tensorchiefs Data Collection and Tools

This repository contains [datasets](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/data/blob/main/docs/) as well as R and Python packages for teaching statistics, data science, and related subjects.


## Installation and Usage

### R

1.  **Installation of the R Package**:
    -   Install the `devtools` package if you haven't already:
        ``` r
        install.packages("devtools")
        ```
    
    -   Install the `edudat` package directly from GitHub:
    
        ``` r
        devtools::install_github("tensorchiefs/data/R/edudat")
        ```

2.  **Using the R Package**:

    -   Load the `edudat` package and datasets:
          ```R
            library(edudat)
            df <- load_data("challenger.csv")
          ```
    -   Showing the dataset and other functionality
          ```R
           show_data(df)
           list_cache_files() #Lists all the cached files
          ```
    -   Using additional functions (currently only in R), like plot_data:
          ```R
          plot_data(df) + theme_minimal()
          ```
        Note that not all datasets have additional functions. They need to be defined in an accompanying qmd script.

### Python

1.  **Installation of the Python Package**:
    -   Install the `edudat` package from PyPI:

        ``` bash
        pip install edudat
        ```
2.  **Using the Python Package**:
    -   Load the CSV data in Python:

        ``` python
        from edudat import load_data

        df1 = load_data("challenger.csv")
        ```

## Additional information/functionality on data sets

The data sets can be described by quarto (qmd) files. These files contain additional information about the data set, such as a description, the source, the variables, and the data types. The qmd files are located in the `data/` directory and are rendered into the docs branch. The rendered files can be found [https://github.com/tensorchiefs/data/tree/main/docs](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/data/tree/main/docs).


In the cmd files, it is also possible to provide additional code for the data sets. Have a look at the [challenger.qmd](https://github.com/tensorchiefs/data/blob/main/data/challenger.qmd) file for an example, where the R-Code `plot_data` is defined as a named code chunk.

``` r
{r plot_data, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
```

Please ensure that `eval=FALSE` is set in the code chunk options if the code is not supposed to be executed in the automatic rendering.

## Structure

-   `data/`: Contains the CSV data.
-   `R/`: Contains the R package `edudat`.
-   `python/`: Contains the Python package `edudat`.
-   `docs/`: Contain documentation on the dataset
